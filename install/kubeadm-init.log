Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of control-plane nodes by copying certificate authorities
and service account keys on each node and then running the following as root:

  kubeadm join k8s-vip.linux.io:6443 --token fhhf0p.s0vd6adibkzlk75v \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:3ace2fd0cb43042ad70bf163e050747eddfac8f7ac92a58cd7a6f37653e28a86 \
    --control-plane 

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join k8s-vip.linux.io:6443 --token fhhf0p.s0vd6adibkzlk75v \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:3ace2fd0cb43042ad70bf163e050747eddfac8f7ac92a58cd7a6f37653e28a86
